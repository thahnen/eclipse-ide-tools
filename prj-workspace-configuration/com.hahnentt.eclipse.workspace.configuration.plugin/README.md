# Eclipse workspace configuration (plug-in)

To use this a application, copy the JAR archive into the *dropins* folder of the Eclipse
installation. Every time a project is imported or opened (already existing) in the workspace this
plug-in is checking for files ending with *.epf* in the *.settings* folder and imports them if
possible.

In contrast to the application this should be used when there already exists a workspace while the
application should be used to create a pre-configured workspace.
